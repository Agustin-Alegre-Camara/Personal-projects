The purpose of this weather app is to prove myself using API tools and development of GUIs for the first time.

The user will be asked to introduce the city that they want to know the weather conditions of. This includes temperature, what it feels like, wind speed, whether it's cloudy or sunny, etc. Then, the API will provide the data to the app, which will display the data in a user-friendly manner on the screen.

Please note that if the inputted city is not stored in the database, the program will return a message to the user to let them know that the mentioned city is not available yet.
