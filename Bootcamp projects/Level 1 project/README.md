The purpose of this project is to develop a program that helps small businesses with splitting and tracking tasks among team members. This will be done by creating code that reads data stored inside two '.txt' files: 'tasks.txt' and 'user.txt'.

The program needs to fulfill the following specific requirements:

The admin is the only user allowed to add new users into the system and view statistics of the total number of tasks and the ones completed.
The users are able to add new tasks filling all the information needed (i.e., team member responsible, task title, task desription, status, etc.).
Users are able to display all the tasks and their information, which is stored in the text file, in an easy-to-read format.
Users are able to view the tasks assigned specifically to them.
Additional information that may be useful: please note that during the development of this project 'task_manager.py' (original file), my coding knowledge was limited to functions, 'for' and 'while' loops, conditional statements and other basic aspects of Python.
