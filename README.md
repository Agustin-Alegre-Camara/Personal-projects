Welcome to my personal projects repository. Here you will find three projects that I developed during my bootcamp, as well as more projects that I will be uploading as I keep
sharpening my coding skills. 

The three projects titled 'Level 1', 'Level 2' and 'Level 3' are my bootcamp projects. My aim is to upload new and improved versions of each one of them without deleting
the original ones, so that you can see the evolution of my coding skills as time passes.

Inside each of the project folders you will find a 'README' file explaining the program purposes, requirements and documentation.
