Welcome to my personal projects repository. Here you will find three projects that I developed during my bootcamp, as well as more projects that I will be uploading as I keep
sharpening my coding skills. 

The three projects titled 'Level 1', 'Level 2' and 'Level 3' are my bootcamp projects.

Inside each of the project folders you will find a 'README' file explaining the program purposes, requirements and documentation.
