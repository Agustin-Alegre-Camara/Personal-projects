The purpose of this project is to develop a program that serves as a stocktake app to the user, being useful for private and small
businesses. This will be fulfilled by creating code that will connect the user to a database where all the data introduced by the user
is stored. Please note the program is written for a book shop as an example, but it can be modified to work in a variety of industries.

The program needs to fulfill the following specific requirements:

  1. The user is able to add and delete books.
  2. The user is able to update information about a book stored in the database.
  3. The user is able to search for a specific book in the database.

During the time I was developing 'databases_project.py', I learnt how to use and implement classes as well as how to connect to 
databases with code, as you will see in the file. 

In the near future I will upload an improved version of this program, showcasing the knowledge I gained since I first created it.
